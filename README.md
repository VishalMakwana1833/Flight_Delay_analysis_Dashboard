# Flight_Delay_analysis_Dashboard

##Project Objective
This project analyzes flight delay patterns across various airports and airlines to identify key factors causing delays. Using Python for data cleaning, Excel for preliminary data handling, and Power BI for building an interactive dashboard, the project provides insights into delay trends, peak delay times, and performance of different airlines.

## DataSet Used
- <a href="">Flight Delay Data</a>

## Question KPIs
- Total number of flights in the dataset
- Total number of minutes delayed (arrival + departure)
- % of total flights delayed beyond a defined threshold
- Most Frequently Delay Reason
- Delay Reason by Airline
- Top Delay Airlines
- Dashboard Interacttion <a href= "https://github.com/VishalMakwana1833/Flight_Delay_analysis_Dashboard/blob/main/Flight%20Delay%20Analysis%20Dashboard.jpg">Dashboard</a>

## Process
- Use airline performance datasets (e.g.,Kaggle). Include columns like Flight Date, Airline, Origin, Destination, Delay Times.
- Clean our data remove nulls & unwanted columns, and Change data types (Date, Whole Number).
- Create DAX Measure for KPIs like Total Flights, Total Delay duration, % of flight delays, and Cancelled Flights.

## Project Insights
- Evening flights and Mondays/Fridays have the highest delays due to peak travel congestion.
- Carrier and late aircraft issues are the top reasons for delays, more than weather-related causes.
- Winter and monsoon seasons see the most flight disruptions due to weather and visibility issues.

## Conclusion
The Flight Delay Analysis revealed critical insights into how time of day, day of the week, airline operations, and seasonal patterns significantly impact flight punctuality. Carrier-related and late aircraft issues emerged as the leading causes of delays, especially at major hub airports.
